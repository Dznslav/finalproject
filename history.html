           <strong> Photography had its breakthrough in France, where the theatre and panoramic painter and diorama owner Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre is the man behind the first successful photographic medium, the so-called daguerreotype. A few years earlier, he had begun working with the scientist Joseph Nicéphore Niépce (1765–1833), who had been experimenting for a long time on how to stabilise images on paper with silver salt. They formed a partner­ship and tried to develop the process together. When Niépce died, Daguerre continued on his own. He found influential friends who promoted his in-vention.

            When the technique was announced on 7 January, 1839 in the French Academy of Sciences, by the physicist and politician Jean Dominique Arago (1786–1853), newspapers wrote about this experiment and the public became interested. Before the end of 1839/40, Daguerre’s handbook had been published in six languages: French, English, German, Spanish, Danish and Swedish.

          <strong>The Scientist William Henry Fox Talbot in Britain experimented with various silver salt solutions on paper. In the mid-1830s, he succeeded in producing a negative image on photosensitive paper in a cam­era and had thus ingeniously invented the negative.

            In 1844–46, he published what could be regarded as the first photographically illustrated magazine, The Pencil of Nature, in which he described the technique and how photography could be used in prac-tice. He himself claimed that its most important use was to produce evidence, but he also had artistic ambitions for his photographic images. It was Talbot who eventually launched the term “photography” (writing with light) for his invention. Many different words and metaphors were used to describe this new medium, but photography was soon established as its proper name.</strong>

          <strong>The first prominent calotype practitioners were active in Scotland, which was exempt from Talbot’s patent restrictions. David Octavius Hill was a portrait painter, and Robert Adamson an engineer. In 1843, they began collaborating as photographers, after Hill had been assigned to portray a group of clergymen and laymen who had left the Church of Scotland and founded the Free Church of Scotland. Hill wanted to use photographs to create individual portraits of the several hundred participants in this assembly.

            It took them more than a year to produce a calotype of each member, and the painting took another 20 years for Hill to complete. They continued working together for four years, until Adamson’s premature death, producing nearly 3,000 photo­graphs of architecture, landscapes, but especially portraits, which they always signed together. They also documented working women and men in the fishing village of Newhaven near Edinburgh in a natural and personal style that was unusual for that period.</strong>
